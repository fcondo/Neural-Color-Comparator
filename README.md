# Neural-Color-Comparator

Neural Network project for Intelligent Systems course

Project specification can be read from the PDF file: [ "Neural-Color-Comparator Specs"](https://github.com/linofex/Intelligent-Transportation-System/blob/master/Contiki%20Project%20-%20NES%202017-2018.pdf)

The developed NN is able to calculate the correct difference between two colors. Starting from the DeltaE formula, the Fuzzy Inference System corrects the inaccurances rised from it.
